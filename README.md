## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Solar Power Plant Analysis Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**. It provides insights into power generation, efficiency, power loss, and the impact of environmental factors on energy production. The dashboard is interactive and allows users to select different KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to visualize key metrics related to solar power generation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Total Power Generated Per Day** 📊
- **Average Hourly Power Output** ⏳
- **Peak Power Generation Hours** 🌞
- **Efficiency Analysis** ⚡
- **Power Loss Analysis** ⚠️
- **Energy Loss due to Temperature** 🔥
- **Impact of Temperature on Power Generation** 🌡️

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍
- **Streamlit** (for UI & dashboard)
- **Pandas** (for data processing)
- **Plotly & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
